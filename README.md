Kernel for private dash geometry servers (gdps) in version 2.11. Written with python and flask. Made to be as resistant to attacks as possible.

[ Warning ]

The kernel does not provide documentation for the initial setup. Also, the core was written for certain needs, so you can see a different functionality or cut out endpoints. It is recommended to use the kernel as a template for your kernel, or for reference purposes.
